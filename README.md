# Hand written neural network for digit recognition (MNIST dataset)

This is a personal project regarding neural network made to better understand the math and logic behind these systems

Language used: python
Libraries used:
* tensorflow (to retrieve the MNIST data)
* numpy
* Numba
* math
* os

## Version 1
The first version (file NNv1.py) uses the simpliest scenario. A neural network consisting of two hidden layers of 32 and 16 nodes respectively
* Cost function: squared error
* Activation function for hidden layers: sigmoid
* Activation function for output: sigmoid
* Test precision: 96.52%
